# Software

We will add software for exploring data produced by the
TIMED satellite's TIDI instrument here.

The TIMED Doppler Interferometer (TIDI) website is here:
http://tidi.engin.umich.edu/

This repository is aimed at giving access to all data processing codes
used for the TIDI project.

Level 1, line-of-sight data is available here:
ftp://tidi.engin.umich.edu/tidi/los/

Level 2, profiles of the winds, are available here:
ftp://tidi.engin.umich.edu/tidi/profile/

Level 3, maps of wind vectors, are available here:
ftp://tidi.engin.umich.edu/tidi/vector/

Currently, we are working on creating python code that will help with
the analysis and visualization of these data sets. As we develop this
code, we will make it publically available here.
